The kPCA class we implemented is in "kernelpca.R", and it is the one used on
our experiments. There is a small tutorial on how to use our class at the
beginning of "Experiments.R", but its use was heavily inspired by "kernlab::kpca".

The experiments commented in the report are in the file "Experiments.R", which
can be executed end-to-end as is. Nevertheless, it is almost like a small
step-by-step guide.

Dependencies of "**Experiments.R**" are: 'kernlab', 'datasets', 'mlbench', 'BKPC'
and our class 'kernpca.R'.
